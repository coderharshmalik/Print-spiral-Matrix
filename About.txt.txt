Here we will print the matrix in spiral order that is,
first first row then,
last column then,
last row then,
first column and soon.... 
until spirality continues.


APPROACH-

1.take an 2d array from user.

2.we will make four variables for row and column.

3.using while loop we satisfy the condition for spirality.

4.using fo loop for each row and column to print,
  the vaues of particular cordinates.

5.Make changes in row and column cordinates.

6.ans


STEPS ARE ALSO MENTIOD IN CODE.
